// last bit of every odd number is always one and even number is always 0 so divding by 2 we are right shifting


vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> res(n+1);
        res[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
                res[i] = res[i/2];
            else
                res[i] = res[i/2]+1;
        }
